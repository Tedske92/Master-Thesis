# Master-Thesis
This is the code for my master thesis project, which was completed on Janurary 1st 2018.

It was about implementation of cryptographic access control using FUSE as local virtual file system and MEdiaWiki as storage server backend. The main idea was to create a distributed file sharing application in which users can share files by firstly not leaving user spcae, but also only send one file over the internet. This was acheived using key rings, an essential part of the project.
